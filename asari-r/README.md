# asariR

`asariR` is an R implementation of [Python asari](https://github.com/shuzhao-li-lab/asari) 1.17.0.
It reads centroided mzML files, builds mass tracks, detects chromatographic peaks,
and generates feature tables for downstream statistical analysis.

Main workflow:

```text
mzML files → mass tracks → peak detection → feature tables
```

## Current status

- The R package can be installed, and its core LC-MS workflow can process real mzML data and export results.
- In one real-data file used for a strict comparison, R recovered all 2,234 preferred features reported by Python,
  but R reported four additional features. The two implementations therefore cannot yet be described as identical.
- The example file took approximately 10 seconds to process in R on the current development computer; actual runtime depends on the data and computer.
- Public R functions are available for LC, GC, DIMS, MS2, QC, and offline result visualization.

## Input Requirements

The input must be a centroided `.mzML` file.

```r
input_file <- "/absolute/path/to/sample.mzML"
file.exists(input_file)
```

The result must be `TRUE`. Do not use a nonexistent path, a directory path, or a zero-byte file.

## Installation

First install mzML reading dependencies:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("mzR")
install.packages(c("jsonlite", "remotes"))
```

Then install asariR from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github(
  "zidongxu01/asari-python-R",
  subdir = "asari-r",
  upgrade = "never"
)
```

Load the package:

```r
library(asariR)
packageVersion("asariR")
```

## First Run

Only `input_file` and `output_dir` need to be changed:

```r
library(asariR)

input_file <- "/absolute/path/to/sample.mzML"
output_dir <- "/absolute/path/to/asariR-results"

stopifnot(file.exists(input_file))

result <- asari_process(
  input = input_file,
  output = output_dir,
  project_name = "my_first_project",
  mode = "pos",
  ppm = 5,
  multicores = 4,
  rt_align = FALSE,
  database_mode = "memory"
)

tables <- asari_read_results(result, table = "both")
View(tables$preferred)
```

For a single file, use `rt_align = FALSE`. For multiple samples, set `input` to the directory containing the mzML files
and use `rt_align = TRUE`.

## Where Results Are Saved

After processing, R prints the project directory and the full paths to both feature tables.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `preferred_Feature_table.tsv` | Preferred features that passed quality filtering; usually the primary result table |
| `export/full_Feature_table.tsv` | Complete feature list, including additional lower-quality candidate peaks |
| `project.json` | Input files, parameters, and project information |

Previously generated projects can also be read:

```r
tables <- asari_read_results(
  "/absolute/path/to/generated-project-folder",
  table = "both"
)

View(tables$preferred)
View(tables$full)
```

Identifiers such as `F1` and `F2` are only row identifiers for the current run. When comparing Python and R,
determine whether two peaks are the same using `mz` and `rtime`, rather than comparing identifiers alone.

## Commands

A command is a word entered in the Terminal that tells the software which type of task to perform. For example:

```text
process --input sample.mzML --ppm 5
```

Here `process` is the command, `--input` and `--ppm` are parameters.

| Command | Purpose | Corresponding R function |
|---|---|---|
| `process` | Process mzML data | `asari_process()` / `asari_process_dims()` |
| `analyze` | Inspect an mzML file | `asari_analyze()` |
| `annotate` | Annotate an LC or GC feature table | `asari_annotate_lc()` / `asari_annotate_gc()` |
| `viz` | Generate offline results page | `asari_dashboard()` |
| `join` | Merge two or more feature tables | `asari_merge_feature_tables()` |
| `list_workflows` | View supported workflows | `asari_available_workflows()` |

New users will mainly need `analyze` and `process`.

### Terminal format

```bash
Rscript -e 'asariR::asari_cli(commandArgs(TRUE))' -- COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

Display help:

```bash
Rscript -e 'asariR::asari_cli(commandArgs(TRUE))' -- --help
```

Inspect an mzML file:

```bash
Rscript -e 'asariR::asari_cli(commandArgs(TRUE))' -- \
  analyze --input "/absolute/path/to/sample.mzML" --mode pos --ppm 5
```

Process data:

```bash
Rscript -e 'asariR::asari_cli(commandArgs(TRUE))' -- \
  process \
  --input "/absolute/path/to/sample.mzML" \
  --output "/absolute/path/to/results" \
  --project "my_project" \
  --mode pos --ppm 5 --multicores 4
```

List all workflows:

```bash
Rscript -e 'asariR::asari_cli(commandArgs(TRUE))' -- list_workflows
```

Use `--help` and the help pages for the corresponding R functions below to view parameters for other commands.

## Common parameters

| Parameter | Description | Common value |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | One mzML file or a directory containing mzML files | Must be specified explicitly |
| `output` | Location for saved results | An absolute path is recommended |
| `project_name` | Project name | Any short name |
| `mode` | Ion mode | `"pos"` or `"neg"` |
| `ppm` | m/z tolerance | Commonly `5` |
| `multicores` | Number of CPU cores | Start with `4` |
| `rt_align` | Whether to perform retention-time alignment | `FALSE` for one file; `TRUE` for multiple files |
| `database_mode` | Storage mode for intermediate data | `"memory"` is recommended for most users |

If you are unsure about the parameters, first process one file using the example settings.

## Other Functions

| Purpose | R function |
|---|---|
| DIMS processing | `asari_process_dims()` |
| Export mass tracks | `asari_extract_mass_tracks()` |

## Python and network requirements

| Operation | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Install the R package | Internet connection required |
| Process ordinary mzML data | No Python or runtime internet connection required |
| `database_mode = "ondisk"` | Python is required to write a compatible pickle file |
| Read a Python pickle file | Python interpreter required |
| Installing the Thermo RAW converter for the first time | Internet connection required; macOS/Linux usually also requires Mono |

When centroided mzML data are already available and `database_mode = "memory"` is used,
the core processing workflow is pure R.

## Known limitations

1. The R and Python implementations produce very similar results, but complete agreement has not yet been demonstrated across many diverse datasets.
2. Peak identifiers may differ; comparisons between versions should use m/z and retention time.
3. `asari_annotate_lc()` provides local mass/RT candidate matching and is not fully equivalent to external JMS/Khipu grouping.
4. GC and MS2 results depend on the calibration table, spectral library version, and tolerances supplied by the user.
5. Before processing a large project, use a small number of files to confirm the ion mode, ppm tolerance, and peak-detection results.

## Development Testing

`testthat` is used only to check the code; it does not participate in mzML processing.

```bash
cd "/absolute/path/to/asari-r"
Rscript scripts/run_tests.R
```

Passing the tests only means that no errors were found in the covered code. It does not by itself prove complete agreement with Python for all real datasets.
